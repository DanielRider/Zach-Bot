# ZACHBOT

## What is ZachBot

This will be a locally ran LLM finetuned on Zach's discord messages. That will then be able to respond to messages, periodically send a message, and respond to slash commands. The purpose is to BUILD SLOP, and maybe learn something along the way.

## Structure

The top level directory has some weird stuff going on with the index.html and index.js. To see what that does run:

```bash
npm run
```

I will remove it eventually.

All JavaScript should be in the Discord_Integration/ directory. That will be the 'main'

Generally i'm going to use the following structure generated by chatgpt
